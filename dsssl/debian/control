Description: Modular DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, for print and HTML
 This package enables the use of DSSSL styling (formatting for output)
 with DocBook SGML or XML files.
 .
 This package contains two DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, one for
 "print" output and one for HTML.  The print stylesheet can be used in
 conjunction with the RTF and the TeX back-ends that Jade provides to
 produce output suitable for printing.  The HTML stylesheet can be
 used to convert DocBook documents into HTML.
 .
 The stylesheets are modular in design so that you can extend and
 customize them.
