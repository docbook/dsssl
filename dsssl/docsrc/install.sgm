<para>In order to process DocBook documents with these stylesheets,
you must get three separate components installed and configured correctly:

<para>For simplicity, these instructions assume that you are working with
Jade on a Microsoft Windows machine. These instructions should be just as
useful if you are working on a non-M$ platform, modulo the normal cross-platform
idiosyncracies (path and filename separator characters, use of drive letters,
etc.)</para>
<para>If you are using another DSSSL processor, <xref linkend="instdocbook">
may still be helpful, but most of the rest probably won't apply.</para>

<title>Installing Jade</title>
<procedure>
<step><para>Download and unpack the <ulink url="http://www.jclark.com/jade/">
Jade</ulink> distribution. Binary distributions are available for some platforms,
including Microsoft Windows, which makes installation a simple matter of unpacking
the distribution. For other platforms, you will need to build Jade from sources.
Please consult the documentation that comes with Jade for more detailed installation
instructions.</para>
<para>You may wish to add the directory where you installed Jade to your <envar>
PATH</envar>. If not, make sure that you use the fully qualified name of the
executable when you try to run the commands below.</para>
</step>
<step><para>Download <ulink url="testdata/jtest.sgm">jtest.sgm</ulink> and <ulink
url="testdata/jtest.dsl">jtest.dsl</ulink>. These are self-contained test
documents. Test Jade by running:</para>
<screen>jade -t rtf -d jtest.dsl jtest.sgm</screen>
<para>This command should silently produce <ulink url="testdata/jtest.rtf">
jtest.rtf</ulink>.</para>
<para>If you get errors of the form:<screen>jade:jtest.dsl:1:72:W: cannot generate system identifier for public

<para>You probably need to setup the <envar>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar> path,
as described below.</para>

<title>Installing the DocBook DTD</title>
<procedure>
<step><para>Download and unpack the <ulink url="http://www.ora.com/davenport/">
DocBook DTD</ulink> distribution. Please consult the documentation that comes
with DocBook for more detailed installation instructions.</para>
</step>
<step><para>The DocBook DTD is composed of several modules. In order for SGML
tools on your system to find these modules, you will need to setup an <ulink
url="http://www.sgmlopen.org/">SGML Open</ulink> catalog file that maps the
public identifiers used in DocBook to local system identifiers. The DocBook
distribution comes with a default catalog called <filename>docbook.cat</filename>
which is probably sufficient.</para>
<para>Note, however, that Jade does not understand the <literal>DTDDECL</literal>
directive in catalog files and will issue a warning if you use <filename>
docbook.cat</filename> unchanged.</para>
</step>
<step><para>In order to find your catalog files, Jade, nsgmlsu, and the other
tools in the Jade distribution examine the <envar>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar>
environment variable. This variable should contain a <envar>PATH</envar>-like
list of the catalog files on your system. I have combined the catalog from
the DocBook distribution and several other DTDs that I use frequently into
a single catalog in <filename>d:/share/sgml/catalog</filename>, so I set my <envar>
SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar> variable to:<screen>./catalog;d:/share/sgml/catalog;c:/jade/catalog;
</screen>If you are using only Jade and the DocBook DTD on your system, this
setting should be sufficient:<screen>c:/docbook/docbook.cat;c:/jade/catalog
</screen>assuming that you have the DocBook DTD installed in <filename>c:\docbook
</filename> and Jade installed in <filename>c:\jade</filename>.</para>
<para>Note: If you are on a UNIX system, the catalog file separator in <envar>
SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar> is the colon, not the semicolon.</para>
<para>One mistake that I frequently make the first time I try to install Jade
somewhere new is to set the <envar>SGML_CATALOG_FILES</envar> variable to
the list of <emphasis>directories</emphasis> that contain catalog files rather
than the list of catalog files. That doesn' t work, it has to be a list of
the actual catalog <emphasis>files</emphasis>.</para>
<para>Another wrinkle to be aware of is that Jade will also search the catalog
files for the <literal>SGMLDECL</literal> entry which specifies the default <ulink
url="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/wlw11.html">SGML Declaration</ulink> to use.
On my system, I have several doctypes that don't use the declaration identified
as the default in one of my catalog files, so I have to explicitly include
the proper declaration when I format those documents.</para>
</step>
<step id="dbtest"><para>To test your installation, download <ulink url="testdata/test.sgm">
test.sgm</ulink> and run following command:<screen>nsgmls -sv test.sgm</screen>The <command>
nsgmls</command> program is a stand-alone SGML parser included in the current
Jade distribution (in previous distributions, it was called <command>nsgmlsu
</command>).</para>
<para>If the <command>nsgmls</command> command produces errors, review your
catalog and resolve the errors:<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Ignore warnings about <literal>DTDDECL</literal> being unsupported.
It is unsupported, and there's no way to disable the warning message. Note,
however, that this may also effect which SGML declaration gets used. When
in doubt, pass the correct declaration explicitly and see if that corrects
any problems. (To parse <filename>test.sgm</filename> with the declaration <filename>
docbook.dcl</filename> explicitly, run <command>nsgmls -sv docbook.dcl test.sgm
</command>.)</para>
